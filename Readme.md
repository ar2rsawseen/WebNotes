<h1>WebNotes</h1>
<p><strong>Alternative for Opera integrated notes, working in all newest browsers</strong></p>
<p>Since Opera 12 was the last verison supporting native Notes, to be able to switch to newer browsers, I decided to create my own Notes, based on what Opera had.</p>

<p><strong>Don't want to set it up yourself, use this version <a href='http://notes.waterbreadinternet.com/' target='_blank'>here</a></strong></p>

<p>All information is stored locally in local storage, so all the information you store is yours to keep and is privately saved only on your computer, where you use it. Which also means there are no back ups nor synchronizations (at least not yet).</p>

<h2>Implemented Additions</h2>
<p>Additionally to what Opera Notes supported, WebNotes can also:
<ul>
	<li>Work in any HTML5 compatible browser</li>
	<li>Print notes</li>
	<li>Change font</li>
	<li>Change font size</li>
	<li>Use Tab in notes texts</li>
	<li>Import and Export notes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Coming up features and fixes</h2>

	<li>Fix My order ordering</li>
</ul>
